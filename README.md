# redis-cache-demo
Create a Node.js + Express application that demonstrates how Redis can be used as a caching layer for GET requests, and how to invalidate (delete) the cache when the underlying data is modified (added/updated/deleted).
🚀 Simple Redis Caching with Invalidation (Node.js + Express)
This project demonstrates how to implement Redis caching for GET requests in a Node.js + Express application — along with cache invalidation when the underlying data is modified (added, updated, or deleted).
